## Story time
It was time for me t oupdate my React and Node skills, but I did not want to stop there. Next.js felt like a logical next step
to take up. So ehre we are, built this little one with thehelp of JSMASTERY and Adrian. Setting one up  ( slightly modded ), for 
my work as wel so we can have a space to collect all our prompts we are using while training ourselves in the future of Promptopia!
